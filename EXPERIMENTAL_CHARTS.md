# 🧪 Experimental Charts Guide

## What I Built

A new **"Experimental"** tab with **10 complex, advanced visualizations** that push Recharts to its limits!

## 🎨 The Charts

### Tab 1: Sankey Flow (Network Analysis)

#### 1. **Sankey Diagram** 🌊
Shows how predictions flow from individual models to final decision
```
    MNB ──────┐
              ├─→ Spam Vote ──→ Ensemble: SPAM
    LR  ──────┤
              │
    SVC ──────┴─→ Not Spam Vote ──→ Ensemble: NOT SPAM
```
**What it shows:**
- Flow of predictions through the system
- How many predictions each model votes spam/not spam
- How votes combine into ensemble decision
- Agreement/disagreement patterns

**Metrics displayed:**
- Total Flow
- Agreement Rate %
- Split Decisions count
- Unanimous decisions count

#### 2. **Funnel Chart** 📊
Classification pipeline stages
```
All Messages (100)
    ↓
High Confidence (85)
    ↓
Spam Detected (45)
    ↓
Unanimous (40)
```
**What it shows:**
- How many messages at each filtering stage
- Drop-off rates
- Final spam detection numbers

---

### Tab 2: 3D Scatter (Multi-Dimensional)

#### 3. **3D Bubble Chart** 🫧
X = Confidence, Y = Agreement, Size = Message Length, Color = Spam/Not
```
        •●●        ← Large red bubble = long spam message, high confidence
    •• ○○          ← Small green = short not-spam, low agreement
  ●●●   ○
     ○○○
```
**What it shows:**
- 4 dimensions of data at once!
- Patterns between confidence and agreement
- Message length correlation
- Clear separation of spam vs not spam

**Interactive:**
- Hover to see exact values
- Zoom in on clusters
- See outliers

#### 4. **Confidence vs Agreement Scatter** 📍
Simple 2D scatter showing patterns
```
High Conf + High Agreement = Good predictions
Low Conf + Low Agreement = Uncertain predictions
```

---

### Tab 3: Composed Multi-Chart (Hybrid)

#### 5. **Multi-Layer Composed Chart** 🎭
Combines 4 chart types in ONE visualization:
- **Area** (blue) - Confidence range
- **Bars** (red/green) - Spam votes per prediction
- **Solid Line** (purple) - Actual confidence
- **Dashed Line** (orange) - Moving average

**Dual Y-Axes:**
- Left: Confidence % (0-100)
- Right: Model votes (0-3)

**Why it's complex:**
- Shows correlation between metrics
- Time-series patterns
- Trend analysis
- Multiple data types overlaid

#### 6. **Stacked Area Chart** 🏔️
Shows each model's contribution over time
```
100% |████████████████| ← Linear SVC
 75% |████████████████| ← Logistic Reg
 50% |████████████████| ← Multinomial NB
  0% |________________|
```
**What it shows:**
- Which model is most confident
- How model confidence changes
- Patterns in model behavior

---

### Tab 4: Advanced (Interactive)

#### 7. **Interactive Active Shape Pie** 🥧
Hover over segments to expand them
```
When you hover:
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  3 Votes    │ ← Expands out
  │  (45 msgs)  │
  │   35.2%     │
  └─────────────┘
```
**What it shows:**
- Distribution of model vote counts
- 0 votes (all not spam)
- 1 vote (split)
- 2 votes (majority)
- 3 votes (all spam)

**Interactive:**
- Hover to see details
- Smooth animations
- Active shape pops out

#### 8. **Multi-Dimensional Radar** 🕸️
Compare models across 5 metrics:
- Average Confidence
- Max Confidence
- Min Confidence
- Consistency
- Agreement with Ensemble

**Why it's useful:**
- See which model is best at what
- Identify strengths/weaknesses
- Compare multiple metrics at once

#### 9. **Horizontal Bar Race** 📊
Model comparison with variance
```
Multinomial NB  ████████████░░ 87% | Var: 12
Logistic Reg    ██████████████ 93% | Var: 8
Linear SVC      ███████████░░░ 85% | Var: 15
```
**Dual bars:**
- Solid = Average confidence
- Striped = Variance (consistency)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Data Calculations

#### Sankey Flow
```typescript
// Count predictions by path
MNB → Spam Vote → Ensemble: SPAM
// Creates flow graph with weights
```

#### 3D Bubble
```typescript
{
  x: confidence * 100,        // X-axis
  y: spamVotes,               // Y-axis
  size: messageLength,        // Bubble size
  color: isSpam ? red : green // Color
}
```

#### Moving Average
```typescript
// Last 5 predictions
avgConfidence = sum(last5) / 5
```

#### Variance
```typescript
variance = Σ(x - mean)² / n
consistency = 100 - variance
```
