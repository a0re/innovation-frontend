## 🔍 Sample Data Features

### **Realistic Variance:**
- Models sometimes disagree (split decisions)
- Confidence varies: 75-95%
- Some unanimous, some split 2-1

### **Pattern Examples:**
```
Unanimous Agreement:
  All 3 models vote SPAM → Ensemble: SPAM (high confidence)

Split Decision:
  2 models vote SPAM, 1 votes NOT → Ensemble: SPAM (lower confidence)

Disagreement:
  Model A: 87% SPAM
  Model B: 91% SPAM
  Model C: 78% NOT SPAM
  → Shows realistic model behavior!
```

### **Cluster Distribution:**
- Prize spam: ~6 messages
- Urgency spam: ~4 messages
- Money spam: ~3 messages
- Account spam: ~3 messages
- Product spam: ~2 messages
